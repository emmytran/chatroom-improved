Welcome to my multi-user chat room program that enables multiple clients to connect using sockets and threading modules in Python. Our program is designed to create a seamless communication experience where multiple users can connect and chat with each other.

To start the program, please ensure that you have Python installed. Once you have Python installed, follow these simple steps:

1. Open a new terminal and run server.py using the command "python3 server.py".
2. Open a new terminal for each client and run client.py using the command "python3 client.py".
3. Chat with other clients by sending messages in the chat room. To exit, simply press CTRL+C.
